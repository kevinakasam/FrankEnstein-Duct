This mod combines the 5015 holder and duct into a single piece to aid with duct drooping and fitment to the fan, while also removing a heat insert and bolt which would otherwise be needed for attaching the duct to the mount. An integrated wedge support piece is included to remove the need for adding slicer generated supports.

The model is fully printable without supports, although the top side of the duct can come out stringy but will still work fine after removing the hanging filament.

The mount is designed to be oriented like this:

The bracket is held in place with a notch integrated into the mount as well as the fan when it is installed, so there is no need for any additional hardware.
